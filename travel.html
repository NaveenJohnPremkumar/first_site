                <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
                <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                    provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains
                    about half the world's active geysers.</p>
                <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year
                    visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of
                    people making bad decisions by visiting <a

                    seeking to see the ancient lure of Egypt.
                    Giza is a city that is very unique for a lot of reasons. One reason why is the ability to be a
                    vibrant city that also is able to blend in its vast historical heritage within its city life . One
                    one side you can see the pyramids , and on the other you can see the bustling night life of Egypt.
                    This city is also very close by to the capital of Egypt , which allows tourists to not only visit
                    Giza , but they also gain the opportunity of going to the nearby capital and getting any work needed
                    done.
