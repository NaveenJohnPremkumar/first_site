          Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can.
          He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He
          enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try
          to consume geese poop.
        </p>
        <p>
          He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a
          bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to
          roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much
          easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German
          shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially
          when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as
          he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he
          demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on
          and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also
          has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his
          father goes to bed.

        <p>
          Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in
          snow and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites.
          He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with
          a smile and a few barks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other
          dogs steal attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When
          Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would
          constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.

        <p>
          Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go
          on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and
          belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys
          in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or
          cooling off in the garage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings
          the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards
          the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his
          tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as
          much as he likes to play.
